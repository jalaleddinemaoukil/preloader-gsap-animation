# GSAP Preloader Animation

A minimal, fast preloader animation built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **GSAP**.  
This micro-project explores how to manage loading states, smooth transitions, and brand-ready micro-interactions for modern websites.

## 🎯 Features
- GSAP timeline-based animation
- Smooth entry/exit transitions
- Lightweight, no dependencies other than GSAP
- Fully responsive and easy to integrate in any landing page

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML

## 📝 Purpose
This preloader is part of my ongoing practice to refine UI motion design, improve GSAP fluency, and build purposeful micro-interactions for my future portfolio.
